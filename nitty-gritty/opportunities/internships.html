                        <strong>Our Philosophy Towards Interns</strong>:<br />
                        Our mentoring interaction with each intern develops a mutually beneficial relationship.<br /><br /> Each
                        intern is given hands-on responsibilities, and our organization continues to grow due to the
                        skills, participation, and involvement of each intern.<br /><br /> In many instances, professional
                        relationships with former students/interns continue long after the formal internship's
                        conclusion.<br /> Since we are a small and growing organization, we can ensure that our interns do not
                        spend the majority of their time on mind-numbing office work. Interns are given significant
                        projects which match their unique abilities.

                                        What I liked about A.E. Schwartz & Associates is that it is a local company.
                                        I've worked for big companies that did not take time to explain to me anything
                                        because they were too busy. Working at A.E Schwartz & Associates has been a
                                        great experience and an amazing opportunity for me. Andrew took time to explain
                                        to me what he wanted me to do, how to do it and he also let me find solutions by
                                        myself. I am from France, so it gave me a glimpse of what it is to work abroad
                                        and live in another country. It was a great learning experience for me and I
                                        feel much more comfortable with working and communicating with people. Andrew
                                        taught me how to market his company and how to use many software. This internship

                                        my schools requirements. Personally I was also interested to learn more about US
                                        business world. I learned a lot during my internship. It was a real “hands on”
                                        experience. Writing requirements, doing website critique, directory listings,
                                        SEO and Social Networking are just a few things which enhanced my resume. It
                                        turned out as an opportunity for the future – coupon project. I’m more than
                                        happy to work with A.E. Schwartz and Associates on this exciting project in the
                                        future. I also found a great topic for my bachelor’s thesis and now I know that
                                        I want to continue studying Marketing after graduating. I’m happy that I got the
                                        opportunity to do an internship with A.E. Schwartz & Associates where I gained a
                                        lot of knowledge. I think one reason for my high involvement was that I was
                                        working full time. As more as you work the more you will get out of the
                                        internship. Consider at least working two days per week to keep on track with
                                        all the things which are going on.<br/>

                                        I really wanted a very hands-on internship. I had never had a marketing
                                        internship before and most of my friends who had an internship in the field only
                                        complained that they didn’t learn much while they were there. I didn’t want my
                                        main tasks to be getting coffee and making copies. I was hoping to continue
                                        completing a lot of writing projects. I wrote a press release in the first month
                                        and really enjoyed doing that. I expected to be given similar projects in the
                                        future. My first goal was to gain an understanding of whether or not I’d really
                                        enjoy continuing marketing as a career. I also wanted to sharpen my business
                                        writing and communications skills. I took on a variety of tasks I had never done
                                        before. I was given the opportunity to write press releases for the first time
                                        and realized my great interest in the PR field. I also was provided with
                                        confidence in my work. I even developed a Power Point presentation that is
                                        actually sold by the company as a product, which I feel is a great
                                        accomplishment. If you are interested in getting your hands dirty and really
                                        becoming involved in the company, this internship is for you. The company is
                                        very small and that opens doors to a myriad of opportunities to try new and
                                        exciting things.<br/>

                                        Search Engine Optimization definitely opened my eyes in internet marketing and I
                                        am willing to continue learning more about it. I did not have knowledge of
                                        internet marketing much. I realized how fascinating it is! I have enjoyed the
                                        meetings of CEOs from New England Small Business Associations. I wish we could
                                        attend all of them. I have gained skills in writing a PowerPoint presentation
                                        and now know the details and little things that really make difference and give
                                        the presentation an eye-catching and organized look. Looking for vendors,
                                        resellers, and affiliates was very useful. This process allowed me to explore
                                        many diverse businesses, look at their compatibility with ReadySetPresent.com
                                        and other sites, get into every page and find external links that connect to

                                        Upon entering the Sales/Marketing internship position, I was unsure of what to
                                        expect. I thought I was going to be entering into a "hyped" up telemarketing
                                        position. Instead, I found that I was continuously challenged with projects and
                                        assignments which encompassed a wide range of arenas. Each of us had a great
                                        impact on the success of the company. I learned more at this internship that I
                                        would have at any other due to the amount of responsibility that I was given,
                                        coupled with the continuous feedback that I received. I would recommend taking

                                        In working as a remote intern for A.E. Schwartz & Associates this summer I was
                                        able to sharpen my copy editing skills by working on a variety of projects
                                        including a book manuscript, marketing brochures, and training modules. I also
                                        helped develop the remote internship program which will enable students from all
                                        over the world to be a part of A.E. Schwartz & Associates. These tasks and many

                                        to write from day one. And during the application process, I was convinced that
                                        I wanted to work here because of the company's friendly, personable attitude.
                                        AES has proved to be an invaluable experience. Not only have I found friendships
                                        all over the US, but I have also published an article, worked on the website,
                                        had my voice recorded for all time on the School for Managers audio tape, edited
                                        and written training modules and reviews as well as learned from the numerous

                                        from my friend's internships is it's multidimensional approach. I have gone far

                                        virtually every aspect of the organization over these 2+ years. This experience
                                        will most definitely lead me further than my peers. I have worked hands-on with
                                        sales, writing, databases, reports, correspondence, marketing, the Internet,

                                        The experience enriched complimented my MBA course curriculum; I applied

                                    <h2>Making the Most From Interns and Internships</h2>
                                    by Andrew E. Schwartz<br/><br/>

                                    <p>
                                        <strong class="purple-txt">Interns and internships</strong>: 
                                        Many job applicants want a job but often do not have the prerequisite
                                        experience, experience that they can only have by getting a job. Managers who
                                        take the chance and hire them may have to spend considerable time and effort
                                        training them, only to find the new recruits unsuitable or unhappy with the jobs
                                        and looking for employment elsewhere.<br/><br/>

                                        One way around this problem for many organizations is an internship program. For
                                        professionals in career transition as well as students and recent graduates,
                                        such programs provide working experience that otherwise would never be supplied
                                        to someone interested in a specific field.<br/><br/>

                                        Types of internship structures range from full-time salary, minimum wage,
                                        stipend, and volunteer, to those in which the interns pay their employer for the
                                        opportunity. Most colleges and universities support internships for students
                                        matriculated in the institution or "work study" positions that do not
                                        necessarily constitute an internship but do provide financial compensation.<br/><br/>

                                        Students are trained at little or no cost to the employer. At the end of the
                                        internship, there is no further commitment, unless an employer feels that the
                                        intern may be qualified and capable for a full- or part-time job.<br/><br/>

                                        <strong class="purple-txt">The Pluses... and Minuses</strong>: The value of offering student
                                        internships, the most
                                        common form of internships is broad and varied. From the student's viewpoint an
                                        internship offers the opportunity to explore career fields before committing to
                                        a major or graduate program and to strengthen skills and abilities. For those
                                        students who have a clear view of their future path, an internship provides the
                                        vehicle for increasing their possibilities of employment in their chosen field
                                        by building professional confidence, making contacts in their eventual field of
                                        endeavor, and bridging the resume gap between objectives and
                                        realities.<br/><br/>

                                        Fortunately for aspiring students, an internship program has real value for the
                                        many organizations and educational institutions that carry on internships on a
                                        regular basis. Interns contribute their energy, enthusiasm and intellectual
                                        curiosity to situations that are often in need of a fresh perspective. Many
                                        interns, through hobbies, talents and non-formal training, have bona fide
                                        knowledge and technical expertise in an area that they are more than eager to
                                        apply in the real world. They are ideally suited to take on special projects
                                        that a full time-personnel cannot be spared for, or to implement short-term
                                        projects for which it would not be cost-effective to permanently
                                        cover.<br/><br/>

                                        Unfortunately, whatever the level of the internship program, the concept is
                                        often either not utilized or under-utilized by organizations. Management is
                                        often unable or unwilling to commit time to the training and supervision of
                                        interns. It is believed that since interns are neither on salary nor permanent
                                        hires, they have little accountability to the organization. It is true, but the
                                        failing is very often that of management for not offering the interns projects
                                        and responsibilities which are anything other than intellectually menial. Since
                                        the intern pool is made up of individuals who need new experiences and
                                        challenges, and are seldom satisfied with rote typing and filing, a misplaced
                                        intern will leave or be continually late for work.<br/><br/>

                                        <strong class="purple-txt">"Intern Wanted"</strong>: There are several important concerns in
                                        implementing an
                                        internship program. Although they apply particularly to student internships,
                                        many of the points raised are equally applicable to an internship for
                                        professionals in a career change. In implementing an internship program, you
                                        need to consider:<br/><br/>

                                        <u>Needs?</u> In identifying your needs for the internship, you need to examine the
                                        chief responsibilities of the position. And the broader they are, the more
                                        flexibility you will be giving yourself and the intern. Decide upon how often
                                        you will need the intern. Gauge any time factor related to the responsibilities
                                        you are assigning. Remember that the intern will not be as experienced as a
                                        regular employee would, he or she will need additional time to get acquainted
                                        with computer and other systems, your style of office management, and other
                                        on-the-job factors. Next figure your ability to offer a stipend. Not only will
                                        offering money bring you more qualified applicants, but it will suitably reward
                                        the intern. Many managers find it easy to offer a stipend in terms of travel
                                        expenses or living expenses, while also supplying miscellaneous costs.<br/><br/>

                                        <u>Advertising.</u> Most college and university career counseling offices contain
                                        internship listings or will post advertised internships. Research the
                                        universities and colleges in your area to find out where it would be most
                                        appropriate to list your internship. For example, if your internship is computer
                                        based, it would be wisest to list it in appropriate technical schools. It is
                                        also beneficial to find out what departments and fields of study are available
                                        in the educational institutions in your area.<br/><br/>

                                        Many departments are willing to list internships for students who are majoring
                                        in their department or who plan to pursue that field. Be broad-minded in this
                                        method of advertising. If your internship involves primarily public relations,
                                        consider departments such as psychology, English, advertising, communication,
                                        and foreign languages.<br/><br/>

                                        When listing the internship position, include several aspects which will present
                                        the internship in the most attractive, but honest light.<br/><br/>

                                            <strong>How To Apply</strong>:<br/><br/>

                                            <u>Application.</u> This is where you give the necessary information on
                                            how and where to apply. Include an address and a telephone number, and
                                            whether
                                            you will be requiring a resume and a cover letter.<br/><br/>

                                            <u>Applicant Interviews.</u> Many managers find it is effective to conduct
                                            an
                                            initial
                                            screening by telephone. This enables them to determine if there is a
                                            possibility
                                            of a good match between the needs of their organization and the applicant's
                                            goals. Candidates who remain then participate in in-person interviews
                                            focusing
                                            on the intern's interest, expectations and skills. Each intern's abilities
                                            and
                                            requirements will be different, and depending on the individual candidates
                                            and
                                            the amount of effort and time one is willing to put in, provisions may need
                                            to
                                            be made to accommodate them. A verbal contract with the intern before the
                                            beginning of the internship is the least that should be done. Some managers
                                            may
                                            prefer a written contract.<br/><br/>

                                            <strong>Keeping Interest High</strong>:<br/><br/>

                                            <u>Supervision</u> is key to the success of the program. Interns like
                                            direction,
                                            but don't
                                            like to feel they are being constantly checked on.
                                            Even this small amount of direction, however, can take a great deal of time.
                                            It
                                            is important to be willing to set aside this time to give the intern
                                            direction.
                                            One method that seems to work calls for a briefing at the beginning of each
                                            day
                                            and a "where-do-we-stand?" briefing at its end. Throughout the day, the
                                            manager
                                            is on hand to answer any questions that might come up - remember this is a
                                            learning experience!<br/><br/>

                                            There needs to also be additional time set aside throughout the duration of
                                            the
                                            internship during which the manager receives feedback from the intern on his
                                            or
                                            her satisfaction with the assignment and suggestions for future directions.
                                            Equally important, interns need to receive feedback on their
                                            progress.<br/><br/>

                                            They need to know if they are performing to the manager's expectations.
                                            Additionally, many interns have chosen to keep diaries and time logs
                                            documenting
                                            their involvement. These can be reviewed at the conclusion of that person's
                                            internship.<br/><br/>

                                            <u>Motivation</u>. It is important to understand what normally motivates
                                            interns.
                                            Interns want to feel as though they are a member of the team -- partners
                                            with
                                            other team members. Employees need to understand this and accept the
                                            intern.<br/><br/>

                                            Limiting intern assignments to routine, mechanical, or uninteresting tasks
                                            will
                                            also limit the program. Interns thrive on challenge and managers need to
                                            have
                                            respect for their talents and capabilities.<br/><br/>

                                            An intern wants to feel welcome but not prejudged. This can best be done on
                                            the
                                            part of the manager through the provision of a desk and telephone--and
                                            anything
                                            else that will make the intern feel comfortable. Likewise it is important
                                            for
                                            interns to know operational procedures, what the boundaries are, and the
                                            framework within which they must work.<br/><br/>

                                            Interns need to have a sense of involvement in planning objectives. They
                                            need to
                                            feel that their ideas have had a fair hearing. The goals and objectives
                                            arrived
                                            at must be within reach and make sense to interns. Progress must also be
                                            observable to them, since one of the most motivating and exciting factors in
                                            an
                                            internship is having the feeling that one is making a difference. For this
                                            to be
                                            the case, they need to be trained to do the job they have undertaken. In
                                            addition, remember that everyone responds well to constructive criticism.
                                            Finally, interns tend to think globally. They want to know not only the
                                            specific
                                            job they will perform and the scope of this job but also its relationship to
                                            other jobs.<br/><br/>
