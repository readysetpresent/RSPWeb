                    <p><strong>GENERAL</strong>

                    <p>This License constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior communications, understandings and agreements relating to the subject matter of this License, whether oral or written.

                    <p>Alterations to this License and to the Schedules to this License are only valid if they are recorded in writing and signed by both parties.

                    <p>This License may not be assigned by either party to any other person or organization, nor may either party sub-contract any of its obligations, except as provided in this License in respect to the management and operation of the Server, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

                    <p>If rights in all or any part of the Licensed Materials are assigned to another publisher, RSP shall [use its best endeavors to] ensure that the terms and conditions of this License are maintained.

                    <p>Neither party's delay or failure to perform any provision of this License, as result of circumstances beyond its control (including, without limitation, war, strikes, floods, governmental restrictions, power, telecommunications or Internet failures, or damage to or destruction of any network facilities) shall be deemed to be, or to give rise to, a breach of this License.

                    <p>The invalidity or un-enforceability of any provision of this License shall not affect the continuation or enforceability of the remainder of this License.

                    <p>Either party's waiver, or failure to require performance by the other, of any provision of this License will not affect its full right to require such performance at any subsequent time, or be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.

                    <p>This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with jurisdiction law; subject to this Agreement, the parties irrevocably agree that any dispute arising out of or in connection with this License will be subject to and within the jurisdiction of the courts of jurisdiction.
                    <p><strong>USE OF AN EXPERT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES</strong>

                    <p>If any difference arises between the parties on the meaning of this License or their rights and obligations, it shall first be referred to an independent expert appointed by agreement of the parties, or, in default of an agreement, by an appointee of RSP's choosing.

                    <p>Any expert so appointed shall act as expert and not as an arbitrator and his decision (which shall be given by him in writing stating the reasons for his decision) shall be final and binding on the parties.

                    <p>Each party shall provide the expert with such information as he may reasonably require for the purposes of his decision.

                    <p>The costs of the expert shall be borne by the parties in such proportions as the expert may determine to be fair and reasonable or, if no determination is made by the expert, by the parties in equal proportions.

                    <p>Revised 01/01/13</p>
