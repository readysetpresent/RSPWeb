                        <strong>Time/Self Management</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Time/Self Management" distinguishes itself from most self-help books by defying the popular categorization "psychobabble". It runs counter to the negative stereotypes of self-help books, and provides a practical and realistic approach towards measurable and long-lasting improvement:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="productDetailsSlidesDesc" style="font-family:Poppins-Regular;font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;">
                            <li>I do not promise perfection or a quick fix. I offer guidance, encouragement, and the means of creating change.</li>
                            <li>Gradually, “Time/Self Management” teaches the steps to improve readers’ lifestyles. The book would be read, explored, and applied over time as opposed to skimmed once and then shelved.</li>
                            <li>Sudden, extreme improvement is easy to accomplish. “Time/Self Management” can teach its readers to permanently change their habits.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Time/Self Management" is clean, concise, and well organized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="productDetailsSlidesDesc" style="font-family:Poppins-Regular;font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;">
                            <li>Readers won’t have to skim through the history of time management or the evolution of management theories. Our readers want strategies and answers and this is the focus of “Time/Self Management”.</li>
                            <li>Unlike other books, “Time/Self Management” is easy to navigate. Each chapter is precisely labeled so that readers can pick and chose the areas of most relevance to their lives. Other time management books overwhelm readers with ambiguous chapter titles and superfluous content, which eliminates potential sales. However, “Time/Self Management” caters to its audience.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Time/Self Management" uses the personal experiences of its readers to enforce each step toward improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ul class="productDetailsSlidesDesc" style="font-family:Poppins-Regular;font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px;">
                            <li>Without a personal connection, commitment to change is unobtainable. “Time/Self Management” addresses our assumptions about time and provides specific, amusing examples of which most could relate.</li>
                            <li>“Time/Self Management” helps readers recognize their mistakes, analyze the causes and effects, and understand their path to change.</li>
                        </ul>

                                    <b>Chapter Description: </b>Welcomes "you" the reader to the book. Explains the main aim of the book: to change attitudes about time and provide practical ways of using time better. Asks you to consider their current attitudes and choices. Suggests making the book work by doing active reading and brainstorming.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b> Understand what the book is about and be comfortable not only reading it but applying it.<br /><br />

                                    <b>Chapter Overview: </b>Goal setting, when used properly, is a powerful and strengthening tool that opens doors of opportunity. However, many people set vague, unrealistic goals with no time boundaries. I guide readers through the criteria involved in setting meaningful, useful, attainable goals, but first I teach them not to underestimate the potential utility of this process.<br /><br />
                                    However, “goal setting” doesn’t ensure results, which is why this book reiterates logging, analyzing, and following-up. Action is the key to improvement and goals enable you to maximize effective action.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b>To focus purposefully on time by formulating meaningful long-range goals.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Chapter Description:</b> Explains the importance of goal setting. Lays out criteria for good goal statements. Suggests ways to improve goal statements and to use them better. Describes setting both lifetime goals and shorter-term goals. Includes questions about how well one's goal statements dovetail with others and how one can reassess one's statements over time.<br /><br />

                                    <b>Chapter Overview: </b> Planning sets you up for success because it requires you to think clearly and comprehensively about what you are attempting to do. By making clear the steps you should take and their available alternatives, it also reduces the chances that surprises or crises will sabotage your efforts. This chapter teaches how to effectively use planning to increase your efficiency. Initially one must identify the importance/urgency of their objectives and how to allot time based on those priorities. The specificity of the plan is essential and should aim for results, not just activity. I discuss the setting of realistic due dates, the necessity of a reward system, the mechanics of planning, as well as the use of to-do-lists.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b>To learn how to lay out a route to any goal<br /><br />
                                    <b>Chapter Description:</b> Explains the importance of planning, its basic principles, and underlying justifications. Describes the mechanics of planning with a notebook. Works through long-term and short-term To-Do lists.<br /><br />

                                    <b>Chapter Overview: </b> Most successful and happy professionals attribute success to their schedules, which are fresh, clear, direct, and focused. Not any schedule will do the trick, however. Here I guide you into creating and maintaining a successful schedule. My strategy involves the division of time between separate aspects of your day, such as meetings/appointments and 2XQ (Quality and Quiet time); how to maintain a lasting relationship with your schedule; the strategy and benefit of time logs; and the evaluation of current time use.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b>To plan and schedule each day's goals and activities in an effective, practical way.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Chapter Description:</b>Explains the importance of daily projecting and recording. Takes a structured, macro approach to brainstorming and scheduling all necessary items on a To-Do list for both work and home. Explains how to critique and develop one's To-Do list and schedule. Explains logging and follow-up and their importance in assessing and changing current time-management habits.<br /><br />

                                    <b>Chapter Overview: </b> Do you know what your minutes are worth? We can accomplish more valuable work in one undisturbed hour than in two hours interrupted just four brief times. Interruptions steal our momentum and break our concentration, which decreases our productivity. Therefore, it is essential that we investigate what is within our self-control, for example setting aside quite time every day, which should be scheduled during your most productive time. I teach readers how to design work to discourage interruptions; how to log/analyze habits, progress, and time use; and other strategies behind increasing productivity.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b>To use one's own best working time to one's advantage and to motivate others to conclude their business in a timely manner.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Chapter Description:</b>Explains the importance of chunks of uninterrupted, high-quality work time. Suggest ways to identify and set aside that time. Suggests ways to maintain control of the time one spends talking and meeting with others on the job.<br /><br />

                                    <b>Chapter Overview: </b> The higher your position in an organization, the more unscheduled time you need to take care of emergencies or anticipate or respond to unusual situations. I also prepare the readers for use of waiting time, which is unavoidable. Effective use of waiting time means: bringing reading wherever you go, taking on bite size pieces of projects during your in-between time, or using it for relaxation.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b>To be more conscious of free minutes as they arise and use them constructively.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Chapter Description:</b>Explains how both expected and unexpected free minutes can be changed from time lost in waiting to time gained for tidying up loose ends, planning, and re-focusing, by oneself or with someone else.<br /><br />

                                    <b>Chapter Overview: </b> Paperwork consultant Robert A. Shiff reports that after surveying hundreds of companies, he found at least five to ten cubic feet of records for every employee— that’s four standard, letter-sized, three-drawer file cabinets’ worth. He found that people waste 20-30 percent of their time tracking down information, sifting through out-of-date information, or searching for something that has been misfiled. This chapter teaches its readers what they can do to minimize this statistic. It begins with your desk area: its organization, cleanliness, and even filing strategies. Saving time depends heavily on the way you handle incoming and outgoing paperwork, which is why we tell you exactly what to do and what not to do. Every minute of the day is an opportunity to gain (or lose) time, so we cover everything from your first task to what paperwork you should/shouldn’t take home after work.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Readers Objective:</b>To handle the least paper in the least time and to exchange and store essential information instead of paper alone.<br /><br />
                                    <b>Chapter Description:</b> Describes how much of the paper management process is within one's control and suggests how to take control: of one's desk space, incoming paperwork, incoming reading materials, outgoing paperwork, filing, technology, and homework.<br /><br />
